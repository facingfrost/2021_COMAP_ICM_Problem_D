The way music evolves is just as complicated as living things. In order to better understand the role of music in the collective experience of human beings, we decided to quantify musical evolution, measuring the influence of previously produced music on new music and musical artists, so as to explore the evolution of music with the change of society.

For the first problem, we use the influence_data.csv to generate a directed network to show the relationship between artists and measure the importance of nodes by the Musical Influence(MI), which is a quantified result by PageRank algorithm. We also explore the importance of each genre in a sub-network, and verify our model according to the result generated from word cloud map.

For the second problem, we first use the Entrophy Method to calculate the weight of each music variable, and then calculate the similarity by Standard Deviation and conduct data analysis to measure the similarity within and between genres.

On the basis of the first two problems and for the third problem, we draw the thermodynamic diagram of correlation coefficient to get the variable with the largest Correlation Coefficient with YEAR, and compare the similarity and influence according to the variables of each genre. Also we visualise the way a genre changes over time and the relation between different genres.

For the fourth problem, we firstly inferred from Principal Component Estimatethat Energy, Danceability and Loudness have a great positive impact on popularity. Then, we conducted Cluster Analysis and concluded that these three variables belong to the same type and the model is correct.

Based on the previous problems, we define revolution period by the increment of songs or musicans and take the 1960s as well as the 1980s as the revolutionary time. We also define musical revolutionists as those who are influential and whose genres differ from their influencers. They are listed and classified in later report.

For the sixth problem, we used Time Series Analysis, Difference Operation and Partial Auto-correlation to reveal the dynamism of the development of genres. 

For the final seventh problem, we tried to identify the social, political and technological changes by the analysis of music data with a rapid change in the 1960s as an example. 

By processing a huge amount of data and establishing models, we accurately explore the evolution of music over time.
